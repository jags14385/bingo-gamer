Bingo File Generator

Rules : https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Bingo

The player needs to announce , when they are 1 square away from a bingo. If the player doesn't announce, they are not eligible for a win.

Additionally, everyone has a reversal (-2) single-time use 
powerup. You can use this on an opponent & make them remove two of their already filled squares.

IF half of these powerUps(as in number of times = half of the audience) are used, a Bingo has to happen with in the next 15 moves, else everyone loses.

Yes, it is chaotic, but amazing fun !!!
